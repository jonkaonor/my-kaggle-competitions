The goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the patient's current survival status based on the data features. \n","\n","Approach v1: Our approach will be to train a Logistic Regression model using sklearn to be used as a baseilne model and to then train a performance-focused model using XGBoost as a learning exercise.\n","\n","Approach v2: After a few days of initial work, we realized that it was feasible within the competition timeframe to improve on Approach 1 by training an Ensemble of models so we changed our approach to training multiple Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models and then combining them into an ensemble.\n","\n","Approach v3: After manual hyperparameter tuning all the models, we realized that the current Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were too weak to be included in the final Ensemble model. Instead we decided to add a LGBM classifier and create an Ensemble model with a LGBM classifier + XGBoost classifier. We also implemented k-fold cross validation for hyperparameter tuning to reduce variance in the results compared to the validation set approach. We also added the original dataset to the synthetic dataset which improved our results significantly. \n","\n","Version History\n","1. v1.0-1.3 - Implemented dataset loading and dataset pre-processing. Added explanations and comments for each step. \n","2. v1.4 - Added Logistic Regression model training and Kaggle submission formatting\n","3. v2.0 - Added Random Forest and XGBoost model training and prediction.\n","4. v2.1 - Added log-loss calculations for each model on the validation set. \n","5. v2.2 - Added initial hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. \n","6. v3.0 - Added LGBM Classifier and did hyperparameter tuning for the LGBM Classifier. Added explanations for model training / tuning\n","7. v3.1 - Combined the tuned LGBM Classifier and XGBoost classifer into an Ensemble model. \n","8. v3.2 - Switched to K-Fold Cross Validation approach for all hyperparameter tuning. \n","9. v3.3 - Combined original dataset with the synthetic dataset for training and updated log-loss scores accordingly.

Ordinal Encoding - Useful when the categories correspond to an ascending or descending order. \n","2. One-Hot Encoding (Default Choice) - For each categorical column, convert it into multiple columns, one for each possible category. This is used when the categories do not have an obvious logical order. \n","3. Numerical Feature Replacement (Advanced) - In cases where the number of categories is cery large (hundreds or thousands) one should consider replacing the categorical columns with a numerical column that converts each category into some number. For example, one could convert a country code into the country's population. \n","4. Embedding Replacement (Advanced) - Alternatively, one can replace categories with embeddings, which are low dimensional vectors that represent the category. \n","\n","Chosen Approach : One-Hot Encoding - In this case, we use a one-hot encoding since none of the categories seem to have an order to the classes (ruling out ordinal encoding) and the number of categories for each column is low (under 10 for all categorical columns) which rules out needing advanced methods.

K-Fold Cross-Validation - In this approach the dataset is divided into k equal-sized subsets. Then we train the model k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the other k-1 subsets as the training set. Finally we use the average score among all k models as the final score. This approach is commonly used since it essentially utilizes  more of the training data for validation (90% vs. 80%). Typical values range are k=5 or k=10. \n","2. Train/Validation/Test Split - In this approach we split the dataset into three distinct sets: a training set for training the model, a validation set for tuning the hyperparameters and a test set for evaluating the final model. By separating the test set and validation set we reduce / avoid overfitting to the test set. A typical split varies but could be 80/10/10 or 70/15/15.\n","\n","Chosen Approach : Initially we used the train/validation/test approach since it is simpler to implement for manual hyperparameter tuning.

However, we were not able to tune the model beyond ~0.43 score. We then looked at what range of hyperparameter values worked in general in other notebooks and tuned within this range which obtained better overall results. \n","\n","Conclusion: After comparing to other XGboost notebooks it was clear in order to tune the model hyperparameters manually one needs a great deal of experience. For example, in the method I have been using where you tune hyperparameters one at a time by simply changing the numbers in the XGBClassifier(n_estimators=700) constructor call, n_estimators=700 performs very poorly and therefore is discarded early in the process. However, it turns out n_estimators=700 performs very well *if* the learning_rate is also tuned at the same time. Instead using more automated approaches with GridSearchCV are necessary to cover a reasonable amount of the hyperparameter search space and to get optimal results.
