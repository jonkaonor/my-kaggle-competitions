The goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the patient's current survival status based on the data features. \n","\n","Approach v1.0: Our approach will be to train a Logistic Regression model using sklearn to be used as a baseilne model and to then train a performance-focused model using XGBoost as a learning exercise.\n","\n","Approach v2.0: After a few days of initial work, we realized that it was feasible within the competition timeframe to improve on Approach 1 by training an Ensemble of models so we changed our approach to training multiple Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models and then combining them into an ensemble.\n","\n","Approach v3.0: After manual hyperparameter tuning all the models, we realized that the current Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were too weak to be implemented in the final Ensemble model. Instead we decided to add a LGBM classifier and create an Ensemble model with a LGBM classifier + XGBoost classifier. \n","\n","Next Steps: Try to implement more robust automated hyperparameter tuning so that we can add additional storng-performing models to the Ensemble. \n","\n","Version History\n","1. v1.0-1.3 - Implemented dataset loading and dataset pre-processing. Added explanations and comments for each step. \n","2. v1.4 - Added Logistic Regression model training and Kaggle submission formatting\n","3. v2.0 - Added Random Forest and XGBoost model training and prediction.\n","4. v2.1 - Added log-loss calculations for each model on the validation set. \n","5. v2.2 - Added initial hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. \n","6. v3.0 - Added LGBM Classifier and did hyperparameter tuning for the LGBM Classifier. Added explanations for model training / tuning\n","7. v3.1 - Combined the tuned LGBM Classifier and XGBoost classifer into an Ensemble model.

This is used when the categories do not have an obvious logical order. \n","3.

For example, in the method I have been using where you tune hyperparameters one at a time by simply changing the numbers in the XGBClassifier(n_estimators=700) constructor call, n_estimators=700 performs very poorly and therefore is discarded early in the process. However, it turns out n_estimators=700 performs very well *if* the learning_rate is also tuned at the same time. This suggests I need to improve my understanding of how hyperparameters interact and automate some of my process using GridSearchCV for future hyperparameter tuning. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"445e5c0d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-31T01:33:03.627281Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-31T01:33:03.626837Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-31T01:33:06.790484Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-31T01:33:06.789639Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.178799,"end_time":"2023-12-31T01:33:06.793014","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-31T01:33:03.614215","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[[0.95522636 0.00567276 0.03910086]\n"," [0.8201933  0.00876411 0.17104259]\n"," [0.9526751  0.02180874 0.0255162 ]\n"," ...\n"," [0.02692841 0.00210882 0.9709628 ]\n"," [0.9697949  0.00630744 0.02389765]\n"," [0.995952   0.00111718 0.00293076]] \n","\n","Validation Set Log Loss: 0.4278836680800047\n"]}],"source":["from xgboost import XGBClassifier \n","\n","# Train the model using xgboost's XGBClassifier model \n","xgb_model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=700, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.04,colsample_bytree=0.168, min_child_weight=17, subsample=0.7) \n","# The fit method learns the parameters (weights) for the model\n","xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","# Predict the probability of each class for the validation set and the test set (Kaggle's unlabeled dataset)\n","y_val_pred_xgb = xgb_model.predict_proba(X_val)\n","y_pred_xgb = xgb_model.predict_proba(test_df)\n","print(y_val_pred_xgb, \"\\n\")\n","\n","# Evaluate the model predictions by calculating log loss for the validation set\n","loss = log_loss(y_val, y_val_pred_xgb)\n","print(f'Validation Set Log Loss: {loss}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d8e58d44","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.012342,"end_time":"2023-12-31T01:33:06.818556","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-31T01:33:06.806214","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# LGBM Classifier\n","Default Model Performance: 0.455\n","\n","Tuned Model Performance: 0.396\n","\n","Approach  / Conclusion: The approach and conclusions are similar to those found in the XGBoost section.
