The goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the patient's current survival status based on the data features. \n","\n","Approach v1.0: Our approach will be to train a Logistic Regression model using sklearn to be used as a baseilne model and to then train a performance-focused model using XGBoost as a learning exercise.\n","\n","Approach v2.0: After a few days of initial work, we realized that it was feasible within the competition timeframe to improve on Approach 1 by training an Ensemble of models so we changed our approach to training multiple Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models and then combining them into an ensemble.\n","\n","Next Steps: Add hyperparameter tuning for each model and combine the models together to form an ensemble.  \n","\n","Version History\n","1. v1.0-1.3 - Implemented dataset loading and dataset pre-processing. Added explanations and comments for each step. \n","2. v1.4 - Added Logistic Regression model training and Kaggle submission formatting\n","3. v2.0 - Added Random Forest and XGBoost model training and prediction.\n","4. v2.1 - Added log-loss calculations for each model on the validation set. \n","5. v2.2 - Added initial hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost\n","\n","Results Log\n","1.

Handling Categorical Attributes/Columns \n","Problem: We use the DataFrame info method to find that there are six categorical columns: drug, sex, ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, edema which we need to convert from text into numerical values since machine learning models cannot handle text data naturally, they can only handle numbers.\n","\n","Possible Approaches: The main approaches for categorical attribute handling are \n","1. Ordinal Encoding - Useful when the categories correspond to an ascending or descending order. \n","2. One-Hot Encoding - For each categorical column, convert it into multiple columns, one for each possible category. This is used when the categories do not have an obvious logical order. \n","3. Numerical Feature Replacement (Advanced) - In cases where the number of categories is cery large (hundreds or thousands) one should consider replacing the categorical columns with a numerical column that converts each category into some number. For example, one could convert a country code into the country's population. \n","4. Embedding Replacement (Advanced) - Alternatively, one can replace categories with embeddings, which are low dimensional vectors that represent the category. \n","\n","Chosen Approach : One-Hot Encoding - In this case, we use a one-hot encoding since none of the categories seem to have an order to the classes (ruling out ordinal encoding) and the number of categories for each column is low (under 10 for all categorical columns) which rules out needing advanced methods.
