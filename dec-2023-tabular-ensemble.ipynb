The goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the patient's current survival status based on the data features. \n","\n","Approach Overview - This is a beginner-friendly notebook that has basic explanations and does data loading, essential dataset pre-processing, and three types of model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The model predictions are then prepared for final competition submission. Currently in the process of adding hyperparameter tuning for each model and combining the models together to form an ensemble.  \n","\n","Results Log\n","1.

Handling Categorical Attributes/Columns \n","Problem: We use the DataFrame info method to find that there are six categorical columns: drug, sex, ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, edema which we need to convert from text into numerical values since machine learning models cannot handle text data naturally, they can only handle numbers.\n","\n","Possible Approaches: The main approaches for categorical attribute handling are \n","1. Ordinal Encoding - Useful when the categories correspond to an ascending or descending order. \n","2. One-Hot Encoding - For each categorical column, convert it into multiple columns, one for each possible category. This is used when the categories do not have an obvious logical order. \n","3. Numerical Feature Replacement (Advanced) - In cases where the number of categories is cery large (hundreds or thousands) one should consider replacing the categorical columns with a numerical column that converts each category into some number. For example, one could convert a country code into the country's population. \n","4. Embedding Replacement (Advanced) - Alternatively, one can replace categories with embeddings, which are low dimensional vectors that represent the category. \n","\n","Solution: In this case, we use a one-hot encoding since none of the categories seem to have an order to the classes (ruling out ordinal encoding) and the number of categories for each column is low (under 10 for all categorical columns) which rules out needing advanced methods.
