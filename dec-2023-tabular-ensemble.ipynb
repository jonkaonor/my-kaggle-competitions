The goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the patient's current survival status based on the data features. \n","\n","Approach v1.0: Our approach will be to train a Logistic Regression model using sklearn to be used as a baseilne model and to then train a performance-focused model using XGBoost as a learning exercise.\n","\n","Approach v2.0: After a few days of initial work, we realized that it was feasible within the competition timeframe to improve on Approach 1 by training an Ensemble of models so we changed our approach to training multiple Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models and then combining them into an ensemble.\n","\n","Next Steps: Add hyperparameter tuning for each model and combine the models together to form an ensemble.  \n","\n","Version History\n","1. v1.0-1.3 - Implemented dataset loading and dataset pre-processing. Added explanations and comments for each step. \n","2. v1.4 - Added Logistic Regression model training and Kaggle submission formatting\n","3. v2.0 - Added Random Forest and XGBoost model training and prediction.\n","4. v2.1 - Added log-loss calculations for each model on the validation set. \n","5. v2.2 - Added initial hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost\n","6. v2.3 - Added LGBM Classifier. Added model consisting of an ensemble of tuned Random Forest, XGBoost, and LGBM models. \n","\n","Results Log\n","1. Initial Logistic Regression Model - 0.52 validation score, 0.52 test score \n","2.

attribute handling are \n","1. Ordinal Encoding - Useful when the categories correspond to an ascending or descending order. \n","2. One-Hot Encoding - For each categorical column, convert it into multiple columns, one for each possible category. This is used when the categories do not have an obvious logical order. \n","3. Numerical Feature Replacement (Advanced) - In cases where the number of categories is cery large (hundreds or thousands) one should consider replacing the categorical columns with a numerical column that converts each category into some number. For example, one could convert a country code into the country's population. \n","4. Embedding Replacement (Advanced) - Alternatively, one can replace categories with embeddings, which are low dimensional vectors that represent the category. \n","\n","Chosen Approach : One-Hot Encoding - In this case, we use a one-hot encoding since none of the categories seem to have an order to the classes (ruling out ordinal encoding) and the number of categories for each column is low (under 10 for all categorical columns) which rules out needing advanced methods.

Then we train the model k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the other k-1 subsets as the training set.

Train/Validation/Test Split - In this approach we split the dataset into three distinct sets: a training set for training the model, a validation set for tuning the hyperparameters and a test set for evaluating the final model. By separating the test set and validation set we reduce / avoid overfitting to the test set. A typical split varies but could be 80/10/10 or 70/15/15.\n","\n","Chosen Approach : Initially we used the train/validation/test approach since it is simpler to implement.
